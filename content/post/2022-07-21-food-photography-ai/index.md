Good-looking food has been a part of internet culture ever since the beginning. Top [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) foodie accounts have millions of followers, and recipe blogs are some of the most highly trafficked content on the entire internet.

But now that large AI-image generation models such as [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) have been made available, perhaps AI can provide new and _unique_ ideas for food content on the internet.

For example, let's say you ask DALL-E 2 to generate `a colorful alcoholic cocktail`:

{{< figure src="58991471.png" caption="_a colorful alcoholic cocktail_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

All the generated images are coherent and do indeed depict a cocktail, although the compositions are inconsistent which may not be what we would want to share on social media.

The best way to improve the image quality of AI-generated images is to use [prompt engineering](https://dallery.gallery/the-dalle-2-prompt-book/), as these models don't create "good" images by default, just statistically average images based on its training data. For example, adding "trending on [artstation](https://www.artstation.com/)" to any prompt for any image tends to make it look a lot more artsy, and the "trending" is a correlative signal with good artwork.

In the case of realistic food, I found that `professional food photography` does the trick for food-esque prompts. Adding that to the cocktail prompt above:

{{< figure src="4915c019.png" caption="_a colorful alcoholic cocktail, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

Indeed, in each image it's a cocktail, but with bonuses such as increased detail, aesthetic garnishes both on the dish and table, and a depth-of-field blur effect to create a central focus on the dish itself. You could share any of those cocktail photos on social media and no one would be the wiser (although you should **always** disclose if images are AI generated!)

This is the first time I've seen AI image generation models generate food well without hitting the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley), and one of the few prompt "ingredients" (pun intended) where the resulting images have a consistent composition. It's not a surprise, especially since, as noted, high-quality food content would be extremely prolific in DALL-E 2's training data.

What other fantastic foods can DALL-E 2 generate?

## 5-Dimensional Hamburgers

The [original DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), announced in 2021 but not publically accessible, went viral primairly due to the incredible creative results from demo prompts such as `an armchair in the shape of an avocado`:

{{< figure src="avocado.png" caption="DALL-E demo, [via OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)." >}}

Although adding "professional food photography" alone works to generate realistic food dishes, you can combine it with a prompt for other shapes, even abstract and absurd shapes that shouldn't be logically possible for certain foods.

Let's start with a basic shape, such as a heart. If you Google "X heart" for any food you will almost always get results (Instagram loves heart-shaped food). What about asking for a heart shape for a dish that by construction _can't_ be in the shape of a heart, such as a taco?

{{< figure src="1b8510d6.png" caption="_a taco in the shape of a heart, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

DALL-E 2 is still able to work around it, even by creating a new type of taco shell and employing optical illusions. And occasionally it cheats, as in the case with the top-right image.

Emoji are also valid options as shapes, which unlike hearts is far less common in Google Images. Let's take a [Cobb salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_salad), which has specific ingredients. Can DALL-E arrange them into a specific emoji?

{{< figure src="05b432b0.png" caption="_a Cobb salad in the shape of the robot emoji, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

The answer is yes.

But we can get more absurd. For example, consider a [Rubik's cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube). Can DALL-E coerce obviously noncubic foods such as a peanut butter sandwich into one?

{{< figure src="32f205b8.png" caption="_a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the shape of a Rubik's cube, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

The answer is a resounding **yes**.

[Latte art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art), or drawing images in the milk foam of a latte, is a popular subset of food photography. But what about _3D_ latte art that goes outside the beverage?

{{< figure src="2dbba05c.png" caption="_A Frappuccino in the shape of a swan, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

What about going beyond the constraints of mere mortal perception of space and time? Can we assign food [non-Euclidean properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry)?

{{< figure src="14d08e41.png" caption="_a Cobb salad in the shape of non-Euclidean geometry, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

Screw it, we can go **further beyond**, let's just make some five-dimensional food.

{{< figure src="73cbb163.png" caption="_A Hamburger in the shape of five dimensions, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

As a puny three-dimensional being, I'll just take DALL-E's word for it.

## Anthropomorphic Foods

Those who were terminally online during the early days of the internet may remember when a grilled cheese depicting the Virgin Mary [sold for the then-ridiculous sum of $28,000](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna6511148). But with AI, we can do a lot more with foods that can look like people and public figures (within the constraints of OpenAI's [content policy](https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy)).

{{< figure src="b98f2197.png" caption="_A Spongebob Squarepants scrambled eggs dish that resembles Spongebob Squarepants, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

Never mind, this avenue of food content is disturbing. Creative, but disturbing.

## A Different Kind of Fusion Cuisine

I demonstrated earlier that the `a X in the shape of a Y` prompt addition can be used the change the shape of food dishes. But what if _Y_ is another dish? Let's try a Cobb salad and a hamburger:

{{< figure src="52f750cb.png" caption="_a Cobb salad in the shape of a hamburger, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

Yes, it fuses them together! Although I am very afraid to ask what the ingredients actually are.

With that, it is now time to commit cruel culinary crimes!

{{< figure src="a201f1f8.png" caption="_an ice cream sundae in the shape of curry, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

{{< figure src="d67f53ce.png" caption="_A chocolate cake in the shape of sushi, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

{{< figure src="12851ff4.png" caption="_a pizza in the shape of a cronut, professional food photography_ (DALL-E 2)" >}}

The possibilities are endless!

## The Future of AI Food Generation

DALL-E 2 is still limited access (and can be expensive), so let's compare with DALL-E mini/[Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com), which provides AI image generation in a free and easy manner. Also released recently, [This Food Does Not Exist](https://nyx-ai.github.io/stylegan2-flax-tpu/) allows for the generation of certain types of food like cookies and sushi at high resolutions, albeit with no customization. For fairness, let's look directly to DALL-E mega (via [min-dalle](https://github.com/kuprel/min-dalle)), which is a newer and larger version of the mini model that has better image quality.

However, DALL-E mega definitely can't compete with DALL-E 2 for this use case:

{{< figure src="robot-mega.png" caption="_a Cobb salad in the shape of the robot emoji, professional food photography_ (DALL-E Mega, `seed = 0`)" >}}

{{< figure src="cronut-mega.png" caption="_a pizza in the shape of a cronut, professional food photography_ (DALL-E Mega, `seed = 0`)" >}}

There's obviously a lot more that can be done here in terms of prompt optimization and customization, and I hope that it's given more ideas for both AI image generation users and foodies who want to make something unique. The DALL-E 2 Discord has used similar prompts such as a [Minion dish](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/comments/vjhsyr/a_michelin_star_dish_of_a_roasted_minion/) with a prompt keyword being `Michelin` to further increase food quality (in my testing it did not work well for the prompts in this post as it makes the portions too small, unsurprisingly). Even when DALL-E 2 becomes more accessible or another newer model that makes better pics is released, AI-generated food pics won't make chefs or social media foodies obsolete.

In the meantime, I've decided to experiment by making a new social media account devoted to sharing esoteric AI-generated food: Weird AI Chef! Please follow [@weirdaichef on Twitter](https://twitter.com/weirdaichef) and [@weirdaichef on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/weirdaichef/), as they have _many_ more absurd AI image generations not used in this post, with more to come!

_Note: None of the DALL-E 2 generations used in this blog post were cherry picked: the "professional food prompt" is indeed that consistent, and the fail states aren't too terrible either._
