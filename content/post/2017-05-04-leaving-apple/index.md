I’ve been working in the San Francisco Bay Area for about 5 years, but I’ve never publicly said where I’ve worked. Well, I was a Software QA Engineer at [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com), on the Applications team.

As of last week, I handed in my resignation. While I am thankful for the opportunities I have had at Apple, it is time for me to pursue working in other areas I am passionate about and search for other companies to further my personal growth and technical skills. Resigning from a good job to look for something new might defy conventional wisdom, but the time is right for me to make this bold career move.

## My Apple Story

I graduated with university honors at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu), from the [Tepper School of Business](http://tepper.cmu.edu) with a focus on Computing and Information Technology (i.e. data architecture and coding algorithms), and a minor in Statistics.

At the end of my senior year, I received an e-mail from a Software QA Manager at Apple (who followed my [comments](http://techcommntr.tumblr.com) at the bottom of [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com) articles) inviting me for an on-site interview. Following an offer, I moved to the Bay Area to start my first post-undergrad job in Cupertino.

While I can't really talk about what I worked on at Apple, I genuinely enjoyed the work, the product, and team. I had a high impact on the final result and I successfully helped qualify many major software releases. However, after a few years, I realized that my technical skill growth was stalling, so I looked for an an internal transfer to another department, ideally in a data analysis/software engineering role.

Having received no responses internally, I realized I would have to expand my search to outside of Apple.

## My Job Hunt

I have a strong technical background from my CMU classes, but not having an explicit Computer Science degree has made it difficult to prove aptitude despite my positive annual reviews and proven experience / technical skills at Apple. So I made the decision to blog with a technical focus here at [minimaxir.com](http://minimaxir.com), which gave me an avenue to showcase my programmatic skills and the opportunity to self-learn practical new tools not covered during the school curriculum, such as [Python](https://www.python.org), [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org), version control with [git](https://git-scm.com), and reproducible analyses via [Jupyter/IPython Notebooks](http://jupyter.org).

This approach has been successful and many readers have liked my my blog posts: often topping [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4bwr7o/relationship_between_rotten_tomatoes_tomatometer/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13429656), driving hundreds of thousands of pageviews. Additionally, a couple of my posts were even cited in larger publications such as the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/30/facebook-news-feed-and-the-tyranny-of-positive-content/) and [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/photos-that-prove-game-of-thrones-happened-in-real-life).

I also published many open-source technical projects to my [GitHub](https://github.com/minimaxir). My [Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings), a project I made in a couple hours on a weekend inspired by my QA-ing at work, is now at **20,000+ Stars** on GitHub. My [Facebook Page Post Scraper](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper), which does what the name implies, is now at 1,000+ Stars and has been used by many other businesses and journalists.

Developers have long argued that job seekers should have a strong public portfolio, as demonstrated experience can account for the lack of a relevant degree. After years of building up my portfolio, it became apparent that most outside recruiters I talked with never looked at my blog/GitHub, despite a strong emphasis of both on my résumé.

I subsequently rededicated my blog as a pragmatic demonstration of relevant skills in the data analysis job market, focusing more on practical analysis instead of quirky insights and thoughts. In the process, I obtained proficiency in a number of modern tools, including [interactive data visualizations](http://minimaxir.com/2016/08/clickbait-cluster/) on the web with [Plotly](https://plot.ly), processing [big data](http://minimaxir.com/2017/01/amazon-spark/) with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org), high-performance [machine learning](http://minimaxir.com/2017/02/predicting-arrests/) with [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM), and even [deep learning](http://minimaxir.com/2017/04/char-embeddings/) with [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

I am now actively looking for a **data analyst/software engineering job within San Francisco**. If you are interested or if you know of companies who are looking for qualified people, please send me an email at **[max@minimaxir.com](mailto:max@minimaxir.com)**.

## Next Steps

So I’ll be using my time over the next couple weeks to openly look for a new job, and to network with others in relevant industries (and be able to interview without taking a day off of work). Things have been improving: my [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14238066) in the Hacker News "Who wants to be hired?" thread generated many leads who really liked my blog/portfolio. If you’d like to meet up in San Francisco and talk about tech and data stuff, just let me know.

I still intend to continue blogging, not as a hobby but in a more purposeful way. I have very ambitious goals and now have more time to execute them at a deeper level. Plans include:

- Web applications leveraging deep learning models, deployed at scale with [Docker](https://www.docker.com)/[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
- Interactive data dashboards accompanying every analytical blog post with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com).
- Code screencasts at 4k resolution on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/minimaxir).
- Data analysis live-streaming with augmented functionality on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/minimaxir).

I have set up a **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/minimaxir)** in order to subsidize my machine learning/deep learning/software/hardware needs for my blog posts. If you have found any of my blog posts useful, a monetary contribution to my Patreon would be appreciated and will be put to good creative use.
